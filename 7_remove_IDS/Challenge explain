You have been given a number of
product IDs to collect from an Amazon
fulfillment center. Each product ID must
be found and packaged. However, you
have been given too many product IDs to
collect today, and so you need to trim
some products from your list so that you
can efficiently collect the rest before the
day's end.
Given a list of product IDs, you are tasked
with removing m product IDs from the list
so that you have the smallest distinct
number of products to collect.
Write an algorithm that returns the least
number of distinct product IDs remaining
after m removals.


Input
The input to the function/method
consists of two arguments:
Ids, a list of integers representing product
IDS:
rem, an integer representing the
maximum number of removals (m),
Output
Return an integer representing the
minimum number of product IDs
remaining after required removals,
Constraints
1 < Ids|] <= 106
0 <3 / < 105
1 < rem <= 105
Example
Input:
num =6
ids = [1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2)
rem = 2
Output:
2



Explanation:
Two possible actions that give the
minimum 2 different product IDs:
Remove 2 items with product ID = 2 and
the final bag will contain items with
product IDs = (1, 1, 1, 3)
Remove 1 item with product ID = 2 and 1
item with product ID=3 and the final bag
will contain items with product IDs = [1, 1,
1. 21
So the minimum number of distinct
productids is 2.
